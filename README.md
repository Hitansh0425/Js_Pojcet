Discription => I am developing a system to manage an online education platform, where each user can be either a Student or an Instructor.it checks for the studendid ,name ,email and if he is eligible so the operator can enroll him and if he is not eigible then the operator can also reject him. This js constructor can show about the detail of student , enroll him and can also reject him. Through this instructor can also do few things like, can get the info about himself or also about anothers, can grade a student and also rusticate a student.



Major Components => 1=> class keyword to create constructor.
                    2=> functions used along with class keyword.
                    3=> objects and methods.
                    4=> this keyword to assign values that are inside the object.
                    5=> new keyword to create objects.
                    6=> extend keyword to inherit properitis.
                    7=> super keyword that specifies the parameters to inherit.

In conclusion => with he help of the function that i have written you can manage few of the basic institutional tasks and it is customisable and can easily customize by a programer who have basic knowledge of javascript. It shows the basic functionality that ho institutional management programs works.


Thankyou.
